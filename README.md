# FIFA 14 Local FUT v2.41.1 BETA 2.25.9 — post-match reporting / tournament reward hotfix

BETA 2.25.9 is built directly on the working 2.25.8 Store/market/consumables branch. It targets the completed-match failure captured after a real Gold Cup game.

## BETA 2.25.9 changes

- Completes Blaze GameReporting component 28 / command 2 with its asynchronous terminal ResultNotification instead of returning only an empty observation success.
- Derives the played offline-tournament round difficulty when FIFA omits `matchDifficulty` from `/match/end`.
- Publishes the committed Completion Award, Skill Award, total match reward and refreshed coin balance in the completed DestroyMatch response.
- Publishes the refreshed wallet balance in `/ut/game/fifa14/user` after settlement.
- Advances knockout tournament progress on WIN, keeps the round on DRAW, and resets the cup on LOSS/DNF/QUIT.
- Persists round 2+ independently of the unsafe first-round opaque tournament blob, so leaving/re-entering FUT does not reset a won round.
- Awards the advertised tournament prize once after a final-round WIN and leaves the cup replayable.
- Preserves BETA 2.25.8 consumables, market, special-pack weighting, squad, record and pack-FPS fixes.

## Target test

Enter Gold Cup, finish round 1 with a win, verify non-zero match coins on the result screen, press Advance, remain connected to FUT, then reopen the cup and verify round 2 is the active round.

## Installation

1. Extract the release ZIP to a normal writable folder.
2. Run `INSTALL_PREREQUISITES.cmd` as Administrator once if dependencies are missing.
3. Run `RUN_FIFA14_LOCAL_BETA.cmd` as Administrator. The launcher auto-detects FIFA 14; if needed, paste the `Game` folder once and it will be remembered in `config.local.psd1`.
4. Wait for the launcher/server to report that it is ready before entering Ultimate Team.

This project expects an existing legitimate FIFA 14 PC installation and does not include the game itself.

### New client build diagnostics

Before adding a new client profile, run the read-only build diagnostic against the user's FIFA 14 `Game` folder:

```powershell
& ".\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" ".\tools\diagnose_fifa14_build.py" `
    --game-root "D:\Jogos\FIFA 14\Game" `
    --output ".\artifacts\fifa14-build-diagnostic.json"
```

Replace the example `--game-root` value with the user's `Game` path. The command writes `artifacts\fifa14-build-diagnostic.json`, does not modify the FIFA installation, and does not make the launcher accept the new build. The next port stage requires this JSON together with the user's runtime logs. Do not copy binary data into the JSON output or into the repository.

## Repository / development

This repository is already prepared for GitHub with `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, issue templates, repository checks, and release-packaging scripts.

To publish a fresh clone/folder:

1. Create an empty GitHub repository.
2. Run `SETUP_GITHUB_REPO.cmd`.
3. Run `PUSH_TO_GITHUB.cmd` and paste the repository URL.

For future releases, run `PACKAGE_RELEASE.cmd`; the clean runtime ZIP is written to `dist\` and can be attached to a GitHub Release. Keep version history/changelogs in GitHub Releases rather than adding separate Markdown files to the repository root.

Generated runtime state, certificates, diagnostics, virtual environments, and release ZIPs are excluded by `.gitignore`. Do not commit FIFA 14 executables, EA DLLs, game archives, account credentials, private keys, or files copied from a user's game installation.

For contributions, keep changes focused and include the exact gameplay/runtime test performed where relevant. For security-sensitive reports, do not post credentials, private keys, access tokens, or personal data in a public issue.

## GitHub issue hotfix notes

This package can now use FIFA 14 from any drive. On first launch it checks `config.local.psd1`, the `FIFA14_GAME_ROOT` environment variable, and common EA/Origin/Steam library locations. If nothing is found, paste the folder that contains `fifa14.exe` once; the choice is saved locally and is ignored by Git. An editable template is included as `config.local.psd1.example`.

Fixed in this hotfix: pack/tournament localization keys no longer resolve to `*`; unlisted pile-5 cards remain visible in the Transfer List; the player catalogue contains 61 goalkeepers instead of 5; and an unknown `futPackSelect` package is preserved with a warning instead of killing startup.

**Known stadium workaround (deferred):** before entering a single-player tournament match, own and apply a stadium card in My Club. A missing active stadium can produce the dark/void match presentation reported in issues #4/#5; this package intentionally does not attempt another risky client stadium patch yet.
